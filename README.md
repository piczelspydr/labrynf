# labrynf
Iteratively, efficiently and effectively deliver quality software solutions

## Simplifies the process of regularly delivering quality features to a software solution, whilst ensuring the code remains clean and scalable.

### Forward Compatible
Assists with ensuring that your code will always be compatible with current platforms and frameworks. 

### Emergent Design
Facilitate an architecture which grows as your solution grows, ensuring Agile development from the start.

### Baked in Quality
Ensuring that automated quality testing is implemented and documented from day one, without compromising the development time.

### A/B Feature Delivery
Controlled feature rollout and removal, without generating messy code and layering technical debt.

### Smaller Development Teams
Simplifies the whole development process.

### Open Source
Promotes the community to shape Labrynf into the tool they need, not the tool they tolerate.

### Developing clean, scalable, quality solutions over time becomes clunky and time consuming.

### How does it work?
With Labrynf, code is developed in small scripts, which  is grouped by feature and linked via patterns. These scripts are then compiled into an composite solution ready for deployment.
